# SBR
Scalable Bayesian Regression. 
R code to perform Bayesian regression for high-dimensional problems with multiple data sources (e.g. different data types). 
For "wide data" with sample size n and dimensionality p>>n, scales to very large p (~10^6 or more).
See the example file for a simple run through and the documentation and Perrakis and Mukherjee (2017) for details.
